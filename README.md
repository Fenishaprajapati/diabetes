1. BMI (Body Mass Index)
Normal Range: 18.5 to 24.9
Overweight Range: 25 to 29.9
Obese Range: 30 and above
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: ~15 (often seen in cases of extreme underweight or malnutrition)
Maximum: 60+ (rare but possible in extreme obesity cases)

2. Glucose Level (mg/dL)
Normal Fasting Range: 70 to 99
Prediabetes Range: 100 to 125
Diabetes: 126 and above (on fasting test)
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: ~40 (low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous)
Maximum: ~600+ (high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, especially in unmanaged diabetes cases)

3. Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic in mm Hg)
Normal Range: Systolic 90-120, Diastolic 60-80
Elevated Range: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 80-89
High Blood Pressure: Systolic 130+ or Diastolic 90+
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: Systolic ~70 / Diastolic ~40 (seen in cases of severe hypotension)
Maximum: Systolic ~250 / Diastolic ~140+ (seen in cases of hypertensive crisis)

4. Age (Years)
Normal Range in Diabetes Studies: Often between 20 and 80
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: Newborns (0 years)
Maximum: 120+ years (in rare cases)

5. Insulin Level (µU/mL)
Normal Range (fasting): 2 to 25 µU/mL (varies widely based on individual metabolic health)
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: 0 (in cases where the body produces little or no insulin, as in type 1 diabetes)
Maximum: 300+ µU/mL (in severe cases of insulin resistance or high-dose insulin therapy)

6. Skin Thickness (mm)
Normal Range: Generally between 10 and 50 mm
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: ~1 mm (thin skin measurement in lean individuals)
Maximum: 99+ mm (rarely above this in obesity cases)

7. Diabetes Pedigree Function
This is a calculated value based on family history of diabetes, so there isn’t a real-life “limit.” Values usually range from 0 to 2.5, but may exceed this in some cases.

8. Pregnancies
Range in Studies: 0 to 17 (typically observed range)
Real-Life Extremes:
Minimum: 0 (no pregnancies)
Maximum: 20+ (though very rare)
